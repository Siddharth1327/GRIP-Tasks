# Task-1: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
In this regression task I predicted the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied.
This is a simple linear regression task involving just two variables.
# Task-2: Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning
In this task I predicted the optimum number of clusters from the given 'Iris' dataset and represented it visually.
